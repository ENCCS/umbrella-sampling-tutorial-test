    "## What is umbrella sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modelling problems require sampling transitions between coarse states.\n",
    "In principle, molecular dynamics simulations will eventually undertake those transitions often enough that insight into paths, barrier sizes, and rates can be gained.\n",
    "But that is extremely inefficient.\n",
    "We would often like to be able to guide or *pull* the sampling to where we need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: membrane permeation\n",
    "\n",
    "![Drug embedded in dehydrated skin cell bilayers](images/permeability.jpg \"Drug embedded in dehydrated skin cell bilayers\")\n",
    "*The permeability of skin to drugs can be estimated by pulling a drug (in the center) across the bilayers that remain after skin cells dry.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: host-guest binding\n",
    "\n",
    "![Guest molecule bound to a host](images/host-guest.png \"Guest molecule bound to a host\")\n",
    "*Host-guest systems model ligands binding to biomacromolecules.\n",
    "The free-energy of binding can be estimated by pulling the blue guest away from the wireframe host.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pathways for pulling\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an initial guess at a pathway, it is much more efficient to bias the sampling to places that lie on that pathway.\n",
    "The system is allowed to explore the equilibrium state described by the normal molecular potential plus the bias.\n",
    "The observed frequencies of configurations can then be re-weighted to remove the effect of the bias.\n",
    "The resulting unbiased samples can be used to get insight into e.g. changes in free energy along the pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples, simple paths for pulling would lie in the horizontal direction, between centers of mass of different groups.\n",
    "Sometimes simple paths do not exist and need to be composed piece-wise.\n"

    "\n",
    "In order to do umbrella sampling, a simulation must be equilibrated at each location on the reaction coordinate, with the umbrella potential active.\n",
    "This can be tricky, because it is often not a simple case of \"click and drag!\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is enough to start from either a bound or free configuration near one of the desired reaction coordinate points, and equilibrate to it.\n",
    "The endpoint of that equilibration might be used to start the next equilibration at an adjacent location.\n",
    "If the locations have been chosen well, this will work fine, because the adjacent location will sample nearby configurations that can be reached easily.\n",
    "However, it means that the last simulation in the series won't start until all the other equilibrations have completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to run \"steered molecular dynamics\" to do a non-equilbrium trajectory that is forced to move along the reaction coordinate.\n",
    "From that trajectory we can pick suitable configurations to start the equilibration at each location along the reaction coordinate.\n",
    "In GROMACS, this is called \"constant-force pulling.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative is \"interactive molecular dynamics\" where the user can link visualization software to a running simulation and choose where to apply forces to effect transitions.\n",
    "This can help to provide insight into possible reaction coordinates, as well as where to sample along them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",

    "All these approaches can introduce a *path dependence* into the configurations chosen to begin the equilibration. This might be a significant risk in a real scientific investigation. How might this be mitigated?\n"
